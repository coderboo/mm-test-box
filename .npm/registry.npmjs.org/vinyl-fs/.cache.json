Information\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Package</td><td>vinyl-fs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Vinyl adapter for the file system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Node Version</td>\n<td>>= 0.10</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar map = require('map-stream');\nvar fs = require('vinyl-fs');\n\nvar log = function(file, cb) {\n  console.log(file.path);\n  cb(null, file);\n};\n\nfs.src(['./js/**/*.js', '!./js/vendor/*.js'])\n  .pipe(map(log))\n  .pipe(fs.dest('./output'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### src(globs[, opt])\n\n- Takes a glob string or an array of glob strings as the first argument.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to. Default is `process.cwd()`\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. Default is where the glob begins. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`\n  - buffer - `true` or `false` if you want to buffer the file.\n    - Default value is `true`\n    - `false` will make file.contents a paused Stream\n  - read - `true` or `false` if you want the file to be read or not. Useful for stuff like `rm`ing files.\n    - Default value is `true`\n    - `false` will disable writing the file to disk via `.dest()`\n  - Any glob-related options are documented in [glob-stream] and [node-glob]\n- Returns a Readable/Writable stream.\n- On write the stream will simply pass items through.\n- This stream emits matching [vinyl] File objects\n\n### watch(globs[, opt, cb])\n\nThis is just [glob-watcher]\n\n- Takes a glob string or an array of glob strings as the first argument.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - Any options are passed to [gaze]\n- Returns an EventEmitter\n  - 'changed' event is emitted on each file change\n- Optionally calls the callback on each change event\n\n### dest(folder[, opt])\n\n- Takes a folder path as the first argument.\n- First argument can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to. Default is `process.cwd()`\n  - mode - Specify the mode the files should be created with. Default is the mode of the input file (file.stat.mode)\n- Returns a Readable/Writable stream.\n- On write the stream will save the [vinyl] File to disk at the folder/cwd specified.\n- After writing the file to disk, it will be emitted from the stream so you can keep piping these around\n- The file will be modified after being written to this stream\n  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder\n  - `stat.mode` will be overwritten if you used a mode parameter\n  - `contents` will have it's position reset to the beginning if it is a stream\n\n[glob-stream]: https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-stream\n[node-glob]: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob\n[gaze]: https://github.com/shama/gaze\n[glob-watcher]: https://github.com/shama/gaze\n[vinyl]: https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/vinyl-fs\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/vinyl-fs.png\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.png?branch=master\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/wearefractal/vinyl-fs/badge.png\n[depstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[depstat-image]: https://david-dm.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.png\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fractal","email":"contact@wearefractal.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-02T04:55:03.590Z","created":"2014-01-16T04:35:13.183Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-16T04:35:13.183Z","0.0.2":"2014-01-22T23:32:53.983Z","0.1.0":"2014-03-01T21:54:54.733Z","0.1.1":"2014-03-17T22:22:42.477Z","0.1.2":"2014-03-17T22:34:49.764Z","0.1.3":"2014-04-17T01:35:55.240Z","0.1.4":"2014-04-17T10:26:05.990Z","0.2.0":"2014-06-01T02:29:09.354Z","0.2.1":"2014-06-03T00:34:12.928Z","0.3.0":"2014-06-10T07:45:37.441Z","0.3.1":"2014-06-25T14:27:39.226Z","0.3.2":"2014-06-25T18:34:05.869Z","0.3.3":"2014-06-26T16:34:58.575Z","0.3.4":"2014-06-27T06:06:48.755Z","0.3.5":"2014-07-30T23:03:26.698Z","0.3.6":"2014-08-02T04:55:03.590Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"http://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.git"},"author":{"name":"Fractal","email":"contact@wearefractal.com","url":"http://wearefractal.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs/issues"},"users":{"conradz":true,"tunnckocore":true,"kxbrand":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"47DDRQMBQZCHMI4KLJE1KY8V\""}
